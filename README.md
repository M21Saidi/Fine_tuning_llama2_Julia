# Fine_tuning_llama2_Julia

## Content Overview

This repository includes the following elements, part of a pair project:

### Jupyter Notebooks
- **data_processing.ipynb**: Handles data processing.
- **Fine_Tune_LLAMA_2_Julia.ipynb**: Details the fine-tuning process for the model.

### Data Files
- **Julia_math_leet.csv**: Contains a single column 'solution' with Julia code snippets sourced from LeetCode and mathematical exercises. This limited dataset was used for the final model training.
- **Julia_test_data_leet.csv**: Used for testing, it features two columns: 'statement' and 'solution', enabling the evaluation of the model's ability to generate Julia code solutions from provided statements.
